1. Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- UNA faculty system with full CRUD and authentication (uses python)
	- Ran on a Linux box that is ssh'd into
	- Static IP - IP permanently assigned to you by your ISP
	- NoIP - A DNS service
	- Cool rock paper scissors game
	- Firebase deployment tool
	- Namecheap for url names
	- Cloudzy for cloud services
	- Windows servers are more resource intensive
	- Windows provides their own web server (also works well with the purple visual studio)

	TELL JOB INTERVIEWERS THAT YOU KNOW SYSTEMS TOO INSTEAD OF JUST PROGRAMMING

2. Concept (Giving my webpage a custom url)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Domain name services allow for your web app to have a custom url
	- These web pages that give you custom URLs operate by telling DNS servers that
	  your specific name goes to your IP address.
	- The common person uses this by using a web interface and having the website do the
  	  rest of the work
	- Implementing this into my web app wouldn't change a whole ton because we already have
	  a url. Though I might be able to get a prettier url even if it is a bit expensive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	How do I pick a good URL name when the seemingly good ones are expensive?

	What did you use to develop you rock paper scissors game?
